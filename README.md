This Repo contains the implementation of COPNCT, a prompt based continual learning model for predictive process monitoring on an online datastream affected by concept drift, prediction task drift, and activity label noise.

Note: Datasets and result files are not included to keep the repository lightweight. 
Please refer to the thesis report for further details.
